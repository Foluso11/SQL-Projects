This analysis was done to clean the data, analyse and find relationships among salaries of tech staff in various companies.
In order to achieve this, I cleaned the data by ensuring that there are no missing values that can be vital to the analysis. This was done by checking through the data to ensure all needed information was complete.
A uniform bases of comparison was created to ensure that comparison is not biased.
Then I went ahead to compare salary based on location and experience level.
I also compared highest salary paid based on job title.
